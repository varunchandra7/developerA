code: string;

message: string;

details?: unknown;

};

metadata: {

timestamp: string;

requestId: string;

user: UserContext;

}

// Performance-optimized component patterns

const AgentDashboard = React.memo(({ agents }: Props) => {

const { state, dispatch } = useAppContext();

CULTURAL SENSITIVITY PROTOCOLS:
- Telugu language content must be linguistically accurate and culturally appropriate
- Traditional medicine concepts require respectful representation without appropriation
- Medical disclaimers must accompany all therapeutic suggestions
- Cultural consultants should validate content before public deployment
- Traditional knowledge attribution must be properly credited
- Sacred or ritualistic aspects should be handled with appropriate reverence
